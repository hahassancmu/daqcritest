      <h2>Data Fusion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In dealing with Big Data, users are faced with different data sources that provide either conflicting information or mutually reinforcing information. In addition, users need to go back to the sources to really understand and use the data. We are working on issues related to continuous data source profiling, active data fusion, adaptive data fusion, and explanatory data lineage.</p>
